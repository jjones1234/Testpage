## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

## Here are the results

	'I got a 90 pagespeed target'
1. I resized and used image compression for the images to load quicker
2. On the html page, the thumbnails had hyperlinks attached to them so I took those images and stored them locally in my image file
3. I minified the bootsrap CSS file

	'I got below 60 fps on my pizza site'
1. I cleaned up the for loops by taking out the fields that declared variables and did the calculations outside the for loop.
2. Adjusted the amount of pieces that were to be made because the site looked similar when fewer pizzas were added.
3. I used Paul Lewis's debouncing method for my scroll events because my pizza site was constantly being reflowed and repainted in the for loop.
4. I used requestAnimationFrame to handle visual updates
5. I also used translate in CSS for the .mover class because it was more beneficial for paint time.- I saw this from Paul Irish's "Moving elements with translate is better video"

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
